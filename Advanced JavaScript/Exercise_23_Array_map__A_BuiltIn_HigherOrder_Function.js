Exercise 23: Array map() – A Built-In Higher-Order Function
What You’ll Learn: The built-in map() taking a callback.
Learning Objectives:
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
let doubled = arr.map((x) => x * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6]
map() is a higher-order function because it takes a function (the callback) as input.
