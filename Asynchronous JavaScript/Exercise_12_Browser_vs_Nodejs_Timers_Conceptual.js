Exercise 12: Browser vs. Node.js Timers (Conceptual)
// This code is conceptual; it works in both browser or Node
console.log("Node or browser environment, concept is similar");
setTimeout(() => console.log("Async callback in either environment"), 1000);
Both environments have an event loop; differences exist in timersâ€™ precision and scheduling details, but the principle is consistent.
