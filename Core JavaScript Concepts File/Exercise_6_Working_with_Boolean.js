// Exercise 6: Working with Boolean

What Youâ€™ll Learn: Boolean values (true and false).
Learning Objectives:
let isSunny = true;
let isRaining = false;
console.log("Is it sunny?", isSunny);
console.log("Is it raining?", isRaining);
console.log("Is sunny equal to raining?", isSunny === isRaining);
We can compare them with comparison operators such as ===.
